Hi ðŸ‘‹!  
  
My name is Pablo Veiga and I've been a full-stack developer since 2013.
I had the change to work on several different and cool projects such as e-commerces, smart cities platform, intranet applications and websites in general.

I'm a JavaScript expert but I also know how to work with C# ASP.NET Core, relational and object-oriented databases, GraphQL, IoT, geo-spatial information, maps, digital business processes and ETL.

Bachelor in Information Systems - CEFET/RJ.
Amateur Writer.  
JavaScript, beer and football lover.
